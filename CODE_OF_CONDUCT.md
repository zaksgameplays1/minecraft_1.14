# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and leaders, commit to creating a harassment-free experience for everyone in our community. We welcome individuals regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward others
- Respecting differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and learning from our mistakes
- Focusing on the best interests of the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual advances
- Trolling, insults, derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Harassment in public or private spaces
- Sharing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. They will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

## Enforcement

Reports of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior should be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [contact email].

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. Community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
